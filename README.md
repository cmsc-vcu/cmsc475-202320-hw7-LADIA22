[Belonging - Finding your place](https://editor.p5js.org/LADIA22/full/rElRnSYjQ)

Simulation of social interaction. The balls are bouncing and colliding into one another represent individuals in a shared space. Balls of like colors attach to each other, while balls of unlike colors bounce off. Metaphor for people forming social groups based on a shared sense of belonging. 

## Prompt - Reflection

[Reflection - The Reflective Rorschach](https://editor.p5js.org/LADIA22/full/YqHrRjpi_)

The sketch draws an inkblot in a four-quadrant style. Drawing in one quadrant is mirrored in the adjacent ones, creating a symmetrical pattern that resembles the Rorschach inkblot used in psychological testing. The symmetrical nature of the sketch reflects on the idea of reflection as it presents a mirror image.

## Prompt - Spirit

[Spirit - Wandering Spirit](https://editor.p5js.org/LADIA22/full/85u8kcR9I)

Generative art sketch depicts a single glowing entity that floats around the screen in a seemingly random pattern. The style of movement evokes the spirit of freedom or a wandering soul.
